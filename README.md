# Pixellock-
This Image Cryptography App, crafted with ReactJS, is designed to provide robust security for visual data by enabling the encryption and decryption of images. This web-based application allows users to convert images into encrypted Base64 strings using the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm, ensuring that sensitive images can be securely shared or stored.

## Key Features:
AES Encryption: The app uses AES encryption, a widely recognized and secure cryptographic algorithm, to transform images into an encrypted format. This ensures that the visual data is only accessible to those with the correct decryption password.

Real-Time Processing: Users can upload an image, input a password, and instantly encrypt the image. The encrypted Base64 string can be copied and shared securely. Similarly, users can decrypt the string back into the original image by entering the correct password.

Secure Sharing: The encrypted Base64 string can be shared over any medium without revealing the image content, offering a layer of security for sensitive images.

User-Friendly Interface: The app features a clean, intuitive UI built with ReactJS, making it easy for users to navigate through the encryption and decryption processes.

Responsive Design: The application is fully responsive, ensuring seamless functionality across various devices and screen sizes, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

Performance Optimization: The app efficiently handles image uploads and cryptographic operations, providing a smooth user experience with minimal processing time.

## Use Cases:
Private Image Sharing: Share confidential images securely across different platforms without the risk of unauthorized access.
Data Protection: Use the app to encrypt images before storing them in cloud services, ensuring that even if storage is compromised, the images remain secure.
Educational Purposes: Ideal for those learning about cryptographic algorithms and web security, demonstrating practical applications of encryption techniques.
